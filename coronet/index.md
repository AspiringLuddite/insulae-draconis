  <h2>What you need to know</h2>

  <p>The Prince and Princess of Insulae Draconis represent the King and Queen of Drachenwald in the Principality. As such ceremonial representatives of the Crown of Drachenwald, the Prince and Princess should be treated as any other royal couple in the Kingdom. In essence, be courteous and respectful of what the Prince and Princess are representing and of the fact that their time is not their own. Much of each event they attend will be spent officiating, being in meetings, or just listening to people's opinions. Read more about how to <a href="{% link coronet/behaviour-around-royal-couple.md %}">behave around the Prince &amp; Princess</a> including at Court.</p>

  <p>The Prince and Princess will hold Court at most events at which they are in attendance. They may have announcements for public business but they also are responsible for bestowing Awards on members where the people of Insulae Draconis has recommended that a member should be so honoured. Insulae Draconis has many awards to reward people for hard work, skill and courtesy. You can <a href="{% link activities/heraldry/awards.md %}">read more about awards</a>, <a href="http://op.drachenwald.sca.org/"> check whether someone already has an award</a> and then <a href="{% link coronet/recommend.html %}">make an award recommendation</a></p>

  <br />

  <h2>Becoming Prince and Princess</h2>
