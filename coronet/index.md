  <h2>What you need to know</h2>

  <p>The Prince and Princess of Insulae Draconis represent the King and Queen of Drachenwald in the Principality. As such ceremonial representatives of the Crown of Drachenwald, the Prince and Princess should be treated as any other royal couple in the Kingdom. In essence, be courteous and respectful of what the Prince and Princess are representing and of the fact that their time is not their own. Much of each event they attend will be spent officiating, being in meetings, or just listening to people's opinions.
