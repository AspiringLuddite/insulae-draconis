### The Castellan/Chatelaine

The Chatelaine co-ordinates and distributes information to newcomers, guests, and interested people and deals with enquiries from potential new members. They are also charged with fostering the growth of Insulae Draconis by helping and encouraging Shires in their recruitment drives.

### What sort of things can I ask for help with?

Maybe you found us on the web or on facebook and are intrigued but would prefer to ask more direct questions, they're a good person to ask.  Maybe you were at a demo recently and saw us in action and you have follow up questions?  Perhaps you would like a friendly person to help you find another friendly place close to your home or place of work, the Chatelaine can help set up introductions.

If you're unsure who to contact about a local group or who to follow up with, they're a good resource.
