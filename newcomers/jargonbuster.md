## Forms of address

One of the pleasures of the Society is using names and forms of address different from our everyday lives. Suddenly you're a lord or lady, and so are the folks across the feast table from you. How cool is that?  

Some titles emerge from members' awards and accomplishments. So if you're new to the Society, and wondering what to call people? 

You'll never go wrong with being polite. If you don't know someone's exact title, a polite 'my lord' or 'my lady' is fine. If you want to learn a persons's preferred title, the simplest way is to ask.

## A gentle guide to some terms

Most hobbies and occupations have specialist terms, that have specific meanings within the group, but remain utterly baffling to 'outsiders'. The SCA is no different. This list focuses on those terms that turn up mainly in Insulae Draconis: other jargon lists are available. 

### Some qualifiers

* Society - terms that are familiar across the Society
* Drachenwald - terms common in this kingdom
* Insulae Draconis - local cool stuff
* Archery - terms about archery
* Combat - terms related to the martial arts, particularly armoured combat and fencing 
* Heraldry - terms about the stylised decorative arts, and the ceremonies, of the medieval period
* Slang - fun terms for explaining modern conveniences

In finished weapons it makes a sword which has a similar weight to a steel sword. Crown and Coronet tourneys are decided by individual armoured combat.|
