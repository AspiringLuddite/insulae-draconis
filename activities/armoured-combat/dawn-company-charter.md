### 1. Purpose 
The Dawn Company was formed to promote, encourage and champion armoured combat in the Principality of Insulae Draconis. The Company is committed to training fighters and trainers and to enabling all its members to seek out ways to improve their skills relating to armoured combat. The Company exists to provide kinship, camaraderie and mentorship. The Company draws inspiration from the Chivalric path and seeks to conduct all its activities through courtesy and honour. The Company celebrates the joy in the art of combat and seeks it out equally in exciting tournaments as well as on the training field.

While the Company was formed to address a specific need in the Principality of Insulae Draconis, and it is to be expected that most of its members are likely to be subjects of that Coronet, the Company welcomes all armoured fighters and those non-fighters who take joy in and support armoured combat by heralding, listkeeping, waterbearing, armouring, marshalling, and myriad other activities, regardless of where they reside. 
 
### 2. Activities

Training (particularly those with no access to regular practice)

Events - we commit to organising armoured combat-themed events and activities at other events throughout the year. These events will include substantial amounts of training, tourneys, and any other classes or activities that pertain to armoured fighting. 

In order to encourage a sense of progress within the armoured fighting community, we will create, maintain and develop a collaborative and supportive community with a system of ranks within the company for the fighters to advance through. 

Once per year a great tournament and feast will be held to celebrate the art of armoured combat. At this event matters pertaining to the running of the company will be discussed and voted upon.
 
### 3. Administration

The Company is headed by the Primus, whose role is to drive and coordinate the Company’s activities. 

The Primus is supported by the Company Scribe, whose tasks include (1) assisting with coordinating the Company’s activities, (2) maintaining the Scroll of Members, (3) maintaining the Company Calendar, and (4) tracking the members’ progress within the ranks. 

The Company Chronicler records the members’ deeds of arms. 

The Scribe and the Chronicler need not be armoured fighters and it is encouraged to draw the persons for these positions from among the non-fighting members of the Society.

The Company can be contacted by email at dc@insulaedraconis.org

In all matters this charter is subservient to Principality and Kingdom law. This charter is a living document, which will be constantly revised and developed as needs or issues arise.

Only full members enjoy the full privileges and responsibilities within the Company. 

As advancement through the ranks is designed to encourage the art of armoured combat, only those members who are armoured combatants are eligible to advance in combat ranks. 

No grandfathering in of previous excellence is permitted and all members start at as an initiate until they have been formally verified for advancement through active participation in the armoured combat community.
 
### 6.1 Company marks


Company marks are gained by participation in martial activities at events listed in Principality or Kingdom Calendars. 

Only one mark may be gained for each weekend of activity (including single day events). Events that span two weekends may accrue two marks. In order to gain two marks at an event which spans two weekends, the Aspirant must have taken part in at least two separate armoured combat activities during that time, either as a marshal or as a fighter.

Examples of eligible martial activities include:

- Fighting in a tourney, melee scenario or war
- Fighting pick-ups
- Participating in training as a trainee, trainer or both
- Marshalling a tournament or war 

All Marks are held by the Company and tracked by the Scribe until such time the member decides to cash them in to become Aspirant to the next Rank.

It is the Aspirant’s responsibility to submit their activities to the Company Scribe by filling in the online form on the Company webpage. Activities may be reported up to one year after they occurred. Activities which occurred prior to joining the order will not count towards advancement. Failure to inform the scribe of activities will result in those Marks being void.

Once the Aspirant believes that they have met the requirements for advancement, and with the support of an existing company member (“Guardian”), they may issue a challenge to the company for advancement to the next rank. The Guardian and the company will organise this opportunity in discussion with the Aspirant. The challenge shall be made publicly known and celebrated on its occurrence. 

A Guardian shall normally be a fighter of the next rank.  If none exist, two members of the same rank can sponsor an Aspirant as joint guardians.
 
### 6.2 Departure from the Company

A member may leave the Dawn Company at any time.

All Company Marks accrued will be void.

A resignation must be in a written form and sent to the Primus, who will then forward the resignation on to the Dawn Company Scribe.

Should a member that has left the Dawn Company choose to rejoin, they may do so, with their latest rank retained, if three (3) Dawn Company members of the corresponding rank or higher support it.

Any time spent outside the Dawn Company will not count towards requirements for the next rank.
