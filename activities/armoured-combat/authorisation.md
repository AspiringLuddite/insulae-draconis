### How do I authorise so I can participate in heavy combat tournaments?

Authorisation is the test a fighter must pass before they can participate in armoured combat bouts at tournaments.  This is not a test of skill, it is just a test to make sure your armour meets the basic safety requirements of the society and that you, as a fighter, know what your responsibilties are, how to behave safely on the field and that you understand the rules.

As a fighter you need to check that you can answer the following to be sure you're ready to take the test:

- Do you know the basic rules of heavy combat? (<a href="https://www.sca.org/marshal_handbook/">Rules on the SCA website</a>)
- Do you know where to find up to date rules and changes
- Are you wearing correct armour? 
- Do you  know a basic shot? 
- Can you safely withstand an attack? 
- Do you know how to acknowledge a hit? 
- Do you know what the stop signal is? 
- Can you &quot;die&quot; safely?

### Important things to note

- Minors under 16 cannot authorise to fight in armoured combat tournaments.
- You don't need to have a full kit of armour that is all your own just to authorise - it is permitted to borrow armour and weapons.
- You will be asked questions and asked to give practical demonstrations
- If you don't know what &quot;Hold!&quot; means, you're not ready :)
