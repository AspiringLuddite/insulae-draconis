Authorisation is the test you must pass with a marshal before engaging in combat. It is not an assessment of your skill but a test to make sure you know the rules as laid down by the society, that you know how to protect yourself in combat situations and you are basically competent with your equipment. You will be assessed on your [knowledge of the Society rules](https://www.sca.org/resources/martial-activities/).  You should also [Download the Drachenwald fencing Rulebook](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/fencing-marshal/) and familiarise yourself with it.
