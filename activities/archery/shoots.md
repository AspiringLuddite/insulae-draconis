The following are the shoots most often run in Insulae Draconis to give you an overview.  
The two most common are the Portsmouth and the Royal Round.  The scores from these shoots held at practices and events get added to running tallies maintained by the [Drachenwald Company of Archers](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/archery-thrown-marshal/#drachenwald-company-of-archers)

# The Doole

From a reference by Sir Jon Fitz-Rauf , OL, OP, RMC, Baron of the Court of the West:
*King Louis IX in 1320 commanded his people to practice the noble game of the bow instead of other dishonest money games.The range was often set up next to the town inn, perhaps for the convenience of the archers and the profit of the innkeeper.*
 
In 16th c. Amsterdam, although the practice goes back much further, ale houses had archery ranges alongside, where folks would team up, and compete for the honour of getting their name on a wall. The ranges were known as Dooles. It was proposed by Lord Yannick of Normandy, the Insulae Draconis Lt. Gen. Of Archers in A.S. 51 that we refer to this 'Head to Head' style shoot as A Doole, The Doole or even just Doole.

### The format of A 'Doole'

_Qualifier stage_: Any number of teams may enter. All teams simply post a score. Knockout stage: Depending on the time available;
best 8 teams, giving Qtr Final, Semi Final & Final or
best 4 teams Semi Final & Final.

Designated Team captains represent their own shire, the other archers in a team do not have to be from the same shire as the Captain, but will represent their Captain's shire at this shoot. (this way, small shires can still be represented by filling their ranks with serfs, mercenaries and/or hapless Master Archers who wander too close).

The shooting format and team sizes can vary, so long as two teams, or individuals from two teams, are shooting alongside each other at any given time.

A scroll detailing the winners will be kept by the LT. Gen of Archers and shall be added to when any other Doole takes place.

### The Raglan Doole

3 person teams.  
Designated Team captains represent their own shire, the other archers in the team do not have to be from the same shire as the Captain, but will represent their Captain's shire at this shoot. (this way, small shires can still be represented by filling their ranks with serfs, mercenaries and/or hapless Master Archers who wander too close).

Qualifiers:  
Shot at 20yds, 3 ends for each team. 3 arrows per person on standard 60cm target faces, 5 zone scoring. Total score from 3 ends giving a maximum of 135 points per team.
The best 8 teams go through to the knockout stage:
(Ties, captains shoot a single arrow, nearest middle wins the tie.)

Knockout Stage:  
The knockout stage shall be shot at an unmarked indeterminate distance, up to a maximum of 20 yds on 3 spot target faces, 3 zone Scoring.
Each round consists of 3 ends.
Each team member shoots 3 arrows per end, one in each face (penalties for doubles. If an archer lands more than one arrow in a single target face, that archer will lose their highest scoring arrow in that face)
