All scores submitted through the Insulae Draconis Lt. Gen. Office will be entered automatically so if your local practice or event scores are being submitted you don't need to worry - if you want to check, get in touh with your local marshal. 

- The Format is best Portsmouth and best Royal Round combined.
- Open bows will have a 15% Handicap in line with the Drachenwald Competition.
- Entrants may post multiple scores but only the highest will count.
- Entrants must post both a Royal Round Score and a Portsmouth to be eligible to win.
- Both scores will be converted to a percentage of the maximum possible score for each shoot, the percentages then added together, making the final score out of 200.

N.B. (The Royal Round is assumed to be 2 Dozen arrows (240 points) and is weighted so that the Period Master score break points for both a Royal Round and a Portsmouth are worth the same when expressed as a percentage).
