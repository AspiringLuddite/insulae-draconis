<h3>COVID:</h3>
Alas the shadow of the pestilence is still lurking so we are taking common-sense precautions against the spread of the virus.

Please take a lateral flow test before arriving on site. Please take the test within the 24 hrs preceding the planned time of arrival on site, and show proof of a negative result on your lateral flow test when checking in. A photo on your phone is fine.

If you have any cold/flu systems, or are otherwise feeling unwell, regardless of their lateral flow results, please do not come to the event.

If you become unwell while on site, should inform the event and the stewards and then leave the site.

While face-coverings/masks are not currently legally required, the event team requests that attendees consider wearing them where possible while indoors.

If a potential attendee has to cancel their reservation due to illness or a positive lateral flow result, before they arrive on site,  the event fees will be refunded in full.
