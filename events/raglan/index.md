Raglan Fair August 5-14 2022</h2> 
<h3>Announcement regarding Raglan Fair 2022</h3>
<p>As announced in court at the recent Coronet tournament we’ve run into some scheduling issues with Cadw and their agreement to sponsor the great fair at Raglan once the pestilence had subsided. We have submitted the paperwork to hold the fair there this year and are currently negotiating with them on what it will cost us. We are looking at backup sites in case we don’t get a viable offer from Cadw and are doing our outmost to have a camping event in August.</p>

<p>The dates we are currently looking at are Friday 5th - Sunday 14th August and I will keep you updated here, on Facebook and in the Baelfyr, if these change and when we have more details of where the fair will be.</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued patience and support.</p>

<h3>We'll still need your help</h3>
<p>Please get in touch with the Event Steward, Shirin, if you'd like to volunteer or to learn about what's involved in making an event like this happen.</p>

<p>Armoured combat, fencing, archery, arts activities, camp planning, reservations/registrations are just a few of the areas needing people to help bring them about.</p>

<p>Many hands make light work, so please consider joining the team!</p>
