<p>Raglan is coming... 
Even though we can't be at Castle Raglan itself this year, the biggest Insulae Draconis event of the year is going ahead - this time at Manor Farm in Bourn, Cambridgeshire.</p><br>
<p>With great happiness, we also share news that Insulae Draconis will have heirs to the thrones selected at Coronet Tourney on the 21st of August, as part of this event.</p>
