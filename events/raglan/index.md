<p>Your Raglan needs you!</p>

<p>Work is ramping up for an in-person Raglan happen at Raglan Castle, this year, but we need help in making it happen. Please get in touch with the Event Steward, Shirin, if you want to help, or to learn about what's involved in making an event like this happen.</p>

<p>Armoured combat, fencing, archery, arts activities, camp planning, reservations/registrations are just a few of the areas needing people to help bring them about.</p>

<p>Many hands make light work, so please consider volunteering!</p>
