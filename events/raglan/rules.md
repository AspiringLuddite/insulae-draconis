If attending the event you must agree to abide by all of the following site rules.

1. Raglan Castle is a historic site, and you must treat the buildings and grounds with respect and follow directions from CADW staff. You must not leave litter on site during the event or after packing up.
1. The site is non-smoking; smokers must smoke in the car park away from the entrance and attendees' cars.
1. The site is discreetly wet; you must hide alcoholic beverages from the public, and underage drinking is not permitted.
1. Do not disturb or remove the turf; you must not drive tent pegs in over 10 cm (4 inches) deep.
1. No naked flames; fires in raised containers such as fire boxes are fine, as are secure lanterns. Where possible, please use LED lights. All flames must be at least 10 cm (4 inches) above the ground, and ember catchers, dampened towels, stones etc must be used to avoid scorching the turf.
1. No tent space will be allocated to commercial tents, and we may need to restrict the number of storage/communal tents.

1. No setting up tents after 11 pm.
1. You must check with event staff before pitching your tent, and only pitch tents in the space allocated to you.
1. Vehicles may only be brought into the castle grounds with the permission of the steward. Please unload as quickly as possible then park to the left of the car park as you face the castle. You must not drive over or beyond the moat bridge under any circumstances. Vehicles must not exceed 5 mph when on the premises, including in the car park.
1. Access to site is between 9:30 am and 11 pm. Overnight access is only in the event of an emergency. Please ensure your travel arrangements will allow you to reach the castle during that time.
1. Raglan Fair is a safe and inclusive space. Respectful and unbiased conduct is expected by all attendees at all times; you may be asked to leave if you behave in a manner that causes discomfort to others.
1. You must follow the safety and regulatory directions of event staff (including stewards, marshals and day/night staff).
1. Some attendees may have compromised immune systems. Please delay or cancel your attendance if you may be suffering from or carrying any communicable illness; if you become ill during the event please remain in your tent until you have conferred with a member of the event team.

1. You must be considerate of other event attendees, CADW staff and members of the public who may have allergies or who may not be comfortable around dogs.
